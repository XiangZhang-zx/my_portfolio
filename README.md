### Fastai Deep Learning Project
- [Practical Deep Learning for Coders - Lesson 2 App](https://huggingface.co/spaces/zhangxiangzx/testing)
  - This app is a customized version of the Lesson 2 project from the Practical Deep Learning for Coders course by fastai. I have modified the model to differentiate between grapes and peaches (instead of the original cats and dogs), and updated the images accordingly.

I hope you find my portfolio helpful and informative. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you for your interest in my work, and I look forward to demonstrating my skills and dedication to the field.
