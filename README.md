## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a diverse range of projects that showcase my skills in Kaggle competitions, Java, C++, and my work in the KPMG Virtual Internship. With a strong foundation in C++, it's my language of choice, but you'll also see my versatility across other languages and frameworks.

### C++ Projects
- **Cars on Campus**: An application simulating vehicle management on a university campus.
- **Check Inorder Traversals**: A tool to verify the correctness of inorder traversal in binary trees.
- **Replacement Selection**: An implementation of the replacement selection algorithm used in external sorting.
- **The Judger**: A system to evaluate and judge code based on predefined test cases.

### Java Projects
- **BabyBirths**: An analysis tool for birth records, providing insights into trends and patterns.
- **WeatherDataAnalyzer**: A program to process and analyze large sets of meteorological data.
- **String**: A collection of string manipulation algorithms showcasing various techniques in Java.

### Kaggle Competitions
- **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster**: An exploration into predictive modeling using the infamous Titanic dataset.
- **Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space**: Utilizing satellite data to understand deforestation and environmental changes.
- **Toxic Comment Classification**: Building models to identify and classify toxic online comments.
