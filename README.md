## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This repository serves as a showcase of my academic and professional journey, highlighting key projects that demonstrate my expertise in C++, Java, deep learning, and data analysis. You'll find my work in competitive Kaggle competitions, significant projects in C++ and Java. This repository also includes my recent research work featured in a paper, providing a comprehensive view of my capabilities as I apply for a PhD program.

### Research Work
- **LLM-StockQuery-Dataset**: This directory contains the complete resources for my research paper titled **"Can LLMs Substitute SQL? Comparing Resource Utilization of Querying LLMs versus Traditional Relational Databases."** It includes the dataset, code, and documentation that explore the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in handling SQL-like queries and their resource utilization compared to traditional relational databases. [Learn more and access the full resources in the project's README](./LLM-StockQuery-Dataset/README.md)
