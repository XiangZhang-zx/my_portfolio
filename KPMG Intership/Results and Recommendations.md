# Results and Recommendations for KPMG Virtual Internship

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

After reviewing the three datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, the following data quality issues were identified:

- Missing values: There were several missing values in the Customer Demographic and Customer Addresses datasets, which could potentially impact our analysis.
- Inconsistent formatting: The format of the data varied between the datasets, making it difficult to merge the data accurately.
- Duplicate records: The Transaction data contained some duplicate records, which could lead to incorrect analysis.

To mitigate these issues, we recommend the following actions:

- Imputing missing values: Missing values should be imputed using appropriate methods such as mean, median or mode.
- Standardizing data format: The data should be standardized to ensure consistency across all datasets, making it easier to merge the data.
- Removing duplicates: Duplicate records should be removed from the Transaction data to avoid any errors in analysis.

## Task 2: Customer Segmentation

To determine which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation, we propose the following approach:

### Phase 1: Data Exploration

- Understanding the data distributions: We will explore the distribution of the data and identify any outliers.
- Feature engineering: We will engineer new features from the existing data to improve the performance of our models.

### Phase 2: Model Development

- Data transformations: We will transform the data to ensure that it is suitable for modeling.
- Modeling: We will develop machine learning models to predict the customer segments that are most valuable.

### Phase 3: Interpretation and Reporting

- Results interpretation: We will interpret the results of our models and select the most appropriate customer segments to target.
- Reporting: We will create a report summarizing our findings and recommendations for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's marketing and growth strategy.

## Task 3: Dashboard Development

To present our findings to the client, we propose developing a dashboard with the following features:

- Data summary: We will provide a summary of the data and highlight any key trends.
- Customer segmentation: We will display the customer segments that are most valuable and suggest which segments should be targeted.
- Marketing and growth strategy: We will propose a marketing and growth strategy for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd based on our analysis.
- External datasets: We will suggest additional external datasets that may be useful in obtaining greater insights into customer preferences and propensity to purchase the products.

We recommend that the client should focus on targeting the Platinum and Very Royal customer segments from the new 1000 customer list. These segments have the highest customer value and are most likely to drive business growth.
