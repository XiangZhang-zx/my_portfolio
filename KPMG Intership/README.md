# KPMG Virtual Internship Project Overview

This project is part of the KPMG Virtual Internship, which aims to provide students with real-world experience in data analysis, data visualization, and business insights. The project focuses on a fictional company called Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, which is a large retailer of bikes and cycling accessories. The goal of the project is to analyze customer and transaction data to provide insights and recommendations for the business.

As a virtual intern, my role in the project involves exploring the provided datasets, cleaning and processing the data, conducting data analysis using statistical techniques and data visualization tools, and presenting my findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner.

Through this project, I will gain valuable experience in data analysis, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, as well as an understanding of the business implications of data insights.
