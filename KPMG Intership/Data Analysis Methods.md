# Data Analysis Methods for KPMG Virtual Internship

During my KPMG virtual internship, I was faced with a challenging task: to consolidate data from three different tables and analyze it using pivot tables in Excel. This task tested both my theoretical knowledge and practical skills.

## Data Consolidation
I learned how to use the VLOOKUP function to copy and paste data across different worksheets and expand the entire Excel table.

## Customer Segmentation
I attempted to use the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to evaluate the importance of customers. However, during the process of calculating RFM values, I encountered issues with the QUARTILE() function. After some research, I discovered that the PERCENTILE.INC() function was more suitable for my needs, as it allowed me to segment data according to any percentile ratio.

## Date Calculations
I initially tried to calculate the date difference using the formula "2017/12/30 - E2," but the result was incorrect. After consulting with colleagues and self-studying, I learned that the correct method for date calculations involved using the DATEVALUE function.

Throughout the internship, I demonstrated perseverance by learning new skills and consulting with others to solve problems. In doing so, I not only improved my theoretical knowledge and practical skills, but also learned how to remain patient and calm when facing difficulties. This experience has solidified my interest in pursuing a career in data analysis.
