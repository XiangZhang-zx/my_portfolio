This code simulates a lottery game where players take turns choosing numbers. 
The game starts with two initial numbers, and each player selects a number from a set of numbers. 
The winner is the player who first selects a number that is the sum of any two numbers previously selected in the game. 
The code outputs the results of each round, indicating which player is out, and the winner(s) of the game.

Code Explanation
The code starts by including necessary libraries and initializing global constants and variables.
The input is read from the standard input, including the initial numbers, the number of players and the number of rounds.
The input data for each round, which is a matrix of player numbers, is also read from the standard input.
The game is simulated by iterating through each round and each player. For each player, a check is made to see if they have selected a number that is the sum of any two previously selected numbers in the game.
If a player is out, they are flagged and their number is added to a set of "out" numbers.
If a winner is found, their number is added to a set of "winning" numbers.
Finally, the output is printed to the standard output, indicating the results of each round and the winner(s) of the game.
