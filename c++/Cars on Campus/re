# Cars on Campus

## Introduction

The Cars on Campus project is aimed at solving the problem of car parking on the campuses of Zhejiang University. With 8 campuses and numerous gates on each campus, the system can collect the in/out times and plate numbers of cars crossing the gate. The goal is to tell the number of cars parked on campus at any specific time and find the cars that have parked for the longest time period by the end of the day. This project is important for efficient and effective management of car parking on the university campuses.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we use a step-by-step approach that involves the following:

1. We create a data structure to store entry and exit times for a car.
2. We create a data structure to store input records.
3. We create a map to keep track of car's existence and corresponding entry/exit times.
4. We create a set to keep track of all cars.
5. We fill up data structures with input data.
6. We sort the record array by time.
7. We perform operations on the record.
8. We output the answers to the K queries.
9. We calculate and store the total time parked for each car.
10. We find the car(s) with the longest total parking time.
11. We sort and output the car ID(s) with the longest total parking time and the time itself.

The data structure we used to store entry and exit times for a car is a struct called 'node', which contains two arrays to store the entry and exit times of the car, a boolean flag to indicate if the car has exited, a counter to keep track of the number of times the car has entered, and a variable to store the total time parked by the car.

## Requirements

This project is implemented in C++ and requires a C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang. The project can be run on any operating system that supports a C++ compiler.

## Usage

To run the Cars on Campus project, simply compile the code and execute the resulting binary file. The program reads input from a file and writes output to a file. The input file should contain the input data in the format specified in the problem statement. The output file will contain the answers to the K queries and the car(s) with the longest total parking time.
