# C++ Projects

This folder contains a collection of C++ projects that showcase my skills in the language, including proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming concepts. Below is a brief description of each project:

## Cars on Campus
A project that simulates parking lot management on a college campus, utilizing object-oriented programming principles. [Read more](./Cars%20on%20Campus/README.md)

## Check Inorder Traversals
A project that checks whether a given set of tree traversals corresponds to a valid binary search tree. [Read more](./Check%20Inorder%20Traversals/README.md)

## Replacement Selection
A project that implements the replacement selection algorithm, which is used for external sorting. [Read more](./Replacement%20Selection/README.md)

## The Judger
A project that acts as a judge for an online programming competition, verifying the correctness and efficiency of submitted solutions. [Read more](./The%20Judger/README.md)

These projects demonstrate my ability to solve complex problems using the C++ programming language and my proficiency in various data structures and algorithms. I hope this folder provides the university application reviewers with a clear understanding of my experience and expertise in C++. If you have any questions or need more information about a specific project, please refer to the individual project folders and their respective README files.
