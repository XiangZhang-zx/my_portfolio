The goal of this project is to perform forest loss prediction on the Planet dataset using the Kaggle platform. 
The code uses the fast.ai library to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the ResNet50 architecture to classify satellite images of the Amazon rainforest. 
The training process includes data augmentation, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. 
Finally, the trained model is used to predict the forest loss on a set of test images and generate a submission file for Kaggle. 
The README file should include the code, instructions for running the code, and a brief summary of the project.
