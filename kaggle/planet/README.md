# Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space - Kaggle Competition

## Introduction
Remote sensing and Earth observation have become increasingly important fields in recent years. With the development of advanced imaging technologies, we are now able to collect detailed and accurate data about the Earth's surface, including information about land cover, vegetation, and other environmental variables. This data is critical for a wide range of applications, from monitoring deforestation and land use change to tracking natural disasters and climate patterns.

Every minute, the world loses an area of forest the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazon Basin accounts for the largest share, contributing to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. To tackle this issue, better data about the location of deforestation and human encroachment on forests can help governments and local stakeholders respond more quickly and effectively.

Planet, the designer and builder of the world's largest constellation of Earth-imaging satellites, is collecting daily imagery of the entire land surface of the earth at 3-5 meter resolution. While considerable research has been devoted to tracking changes in forests, it typically depends on coarse-resolution imagery from Landsat (30 meter pixels) or MODIS (250 meter pixels). This limits its effectiveness in areas where small-scale deforestation or forest degradation dominate.

Planet and its Brazilian partner SCCON launched a Kaggle competition that challenges participants to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use. Resulting algorithms will help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.

## Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition comes from Planet's Earth-imaging satellites, which capture daily imagery of the Earth's surface at high resolution. The images are provided in TIF and JPG formats, and include both training and test sets. The training set also comes with a CSV file that lists the training file names and their corresponding labels, which are space-delimited. Additionally, there is a sample submission file provided, which contains all the files in the test set.

The data is particularly important for understanding deforestation in the Amazon Basin, which contributes to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, climate change, and other devastating effects. By analyzing the images, researchers can identify areas where deforestation is occurring, as well as track changes in vegetation cover and other environmental variables.

## Class Labels
The class labels for this task were chosen in collaboration with Planet's Impact team and represent a reasonable subset of phenomena of interest in the Amazon basin. The labels can broadly be broken into three groups: atmospheric conditions, common land cover/land use phenomena, and rare land cover/land use phenomena. Each chip will have one and potentially more than one atmospheric label and zero or more common and rare labels.

By using these labels, researchers can train machine learning algorithms to automatically identify different types of land cover and land use in the Amazon Basin. This can help to identify areas where deforestation is occurring, as well as track changes in vegetation cover and other environmental variables over time.

Overall, the Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space competition has been a valuable opportunity for Kagglers to apply their skills and knowledge to an important real-world problem, and to contribute to the development of innovative solutions that can have a positive impact on the environment and society.
