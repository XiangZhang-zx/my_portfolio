Planet Understanding the Amazon from Space

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

# Kaggle Projects

This folder contains my Kaggle competition projects. Kaggle is a platform that hosts data science competitions, and I have participated in several competitions to improve my data analysis and machine learning skills.

## [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](./Planet%20Understanding%20the%20Amazon%20from%20Space/README.md)

In this competition, the goal was to label satellite images of the Amazon rainforest in order to understand how deforestation and other human activities are impacting the environment. I used deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, to analyze the satellite images and identify various types of land cover and land use.

## [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](./Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster/README.md)

This is a classic machine learning competition on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, and passenger class. I used various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, to build a predictive model with high accuracy.
