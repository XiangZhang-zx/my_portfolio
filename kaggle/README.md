Planet Understanding the Amazon from Space

Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

# Kaggle Projects

This folder contains my Kaggle competition projects. Kaggle is a platform that hosts data science competitions, and I have participated in several competitions to improve my data analysis and machine learning skills.

## [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](./Planet%20Understanding%20the%20Amazon%20from%20Space/README.md)

In this competition, the goal was to label satellite images of the Amazon rainforest in order to understand how deforestation and other human activities are impacting the environment. I used deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, to analyze the satellite images and identify various types of land cover and land use.

## [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](./Titanic%20-%20Machine%20Learning%20from%20Disaster/README.md)

This is a classic machine learning competition on Kaggle, where the goal is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features such as age, sex, and passenger class. I used various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, to build a predictive model with high accuracy.

Toxic Comment Classification Challenge

In this project, I tackled the challenge of identifying and classifying toxic online comments. The objective was to predict the probability of various types of toxicity for each comment, including toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. I utilized various machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to achieve this goal.
